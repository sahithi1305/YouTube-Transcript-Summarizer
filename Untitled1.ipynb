Bailey: \"This is actually like an insane psychiatric asylum. They\\\\\\'re currently looking at all the stuff we put in there. They have everything they need to survive\"\\', \\' Suzie and Bailey started their experiment at 2:37 a.m. on their second day after only sleeping for 2 hours . Suzie: \"I just keep thinking of the feeling like exiting. Oh, yeah? How good is that going to feel? It\\\\\\'s only a 100 sleeps. Only 100 sleeps\"\\', \\' Time in the chamber consisted of two things trying to hide from the bright light. The lights are just so bright, they have to make these things to shield themselves. And desperate attempts to keep themselves entertained. Like on day four, when they use the paper from their journals to make a deck of playing cards.\\', \" It\\'s crazy to me that already on day 9 of this challenge, they\\'re already bored enough to expose the red line that if they cross, they lose every dollar of their prize money . Bailey\\'s lost it. He\\'s whipping the pork. The veggies never stood a chance. Five more throws. But I only need one. Let\\'s freakin go, baby, baby . The whole dooropening thing is so dramatic. How\\'s it going?\", \" For day ten, we\\'re going to give you the option to buy a private chef that\\'ll cook you whatever you want between now and the end of the challenge for $50,000 . Use this as a floor for your imagination as to what you could be eating for 90 days .\", \\' Suzie and Bailey were already starting to regret their decision . The next few days were pretty mind-numbing for the both of them . Their routine consisted of waking up, cooking food, and then eventually just going back to sleep . Suzie: \"I\\\\\\'m proud of us staying strong. Good job\"\\', \\' Day 20 offer: $50,000 of prize money combined for smart beds and iPad with ability to turn off lights . They have exactly one hour to decide if they want to spend $50k of their prize money on smart beds . Suzie and Suzie are happy with the offer: \"I haven\\\\\\'t seen Suzie this happy since we started the challenge\"\\', \" It\\'s only 10% of our money. with if we don\\'t say yes. It\\'s decision time. Do you want this comfortable beds? I\\'m actually okay with whatever you say. Oh, my gosh. I think they\\'re going to take it. I can\\'t believe that in the heat of the moment. I feel that slight regret right now. I don\\'t regret in your decision.\", \" Day 30 is the 30th episode of The Daily Mail\\'s weekly television show .

Or you can buy a monopoly monopoly for $10,000 . You could buy all five items: coffee, the Harry Potter books, the phone calls, the spices, the seasoning, the coffee machine and Monopoly .\\', \" The most interesting thing was when hurricane Idalia took out the power on day 34 . As you can imagine, our cameras became useless . So I\\'m just going to take you to day 39. How\\'s it going? - Hello? The power\\'s on. Oh there we go. You should be able to use your coffee pot again, cook food, have a hot shower .\", \" Every single movie is $10,000 a pop. You have one hour to decide. The best I could do is buy one, get one half off. The amount of movies in here is crazy. We can watch this documentary about Nolan. We left Suzie and Bailey to discuss the offer and told them we\\'d be back later, but they didn\\'t seem too interested.\", \" The only thing that Bailey and Suzie can watch is a race car race . Tomorrow is the 50th anniversary of Bailey\\'s mother\\'s birthday . Bailey will spend the rest of the day decorating her with toilet paper for her 50th birthday party . He says he\\'s going to use toilet paper to do streamers and decorate the wall .\", \" The offer for day 50 is $20,000 for you to see your family .

But it\\'s my mom\\'s birthday today and it\\'s her birthday today .\", \" The two are spending $50,000 to keep what they talk about in the cube . It\\'s little things like that you don\\'t realize you won\\'t have until you\\'re in it . The only thing I\\'d say yes to at this point is like if they do Tesla. That\\'s the worst feeling so far. The highest of highs .\", \" It\\'s not going to be equal to the value that we\\'re spending. It\\'s almost three times more. I don\\'t feel confident in the yes. Then let\\'s say no. I think we should. I know, I think it might be worth it. I can\\'t believe you guys didn\\'t take it. Imagine it is something great and we said no. Would it ever be a car?\", \" Bailey: After getting hit hard by yesterday\\'s offer, Suzie literally whined about the Tesla for nine days straight . Bailey: Suzie\\'s taking it hard, so to make up for it, I made sure this next offer was the best one yet. Suzie: Today\\'s a big day because this is the last offer. You leave their Beef. Thank you.  Bye. Bailey: I feel defeated. We\\'re going to head out.\", \" There\\'s only 20 days left and on day 90 you\\'re going to be like, why would we spend money? - There\\'s ten days left, correct?- Let me just open the doors. What you see here is everything you\\'ve said no to so far in this challenge . If you guys say no, we have to move all of this back out .\", \" The Shop app is the best way to shop on your phone and it\\'s completely free .

I think it\\'s an investment for sure .\", \" The hot water tank here runs out so quickly and Bailey always showers before me, so I\\'ve been stuck with cold water for a couple of months now . We\\'ve been playing the same Monopoly game for like seven days because Suzie refuses to play like I maybe she just \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0hates board games. I think we need to take like three days and cram as many movies as we can. ed on the outside was a hot shower that I also did not share with anyone.\", \\' Bailey: \"I just had to come in here because I can\\\\\\'t go anywhere else. That\\\\\\'s a rave right there. Oh, get me out of here. You\\\\\\'re the worst\" With the end so close, they set their differences aside and counted down the days .\\', \\' The final night of the show\\\\\\'s first episode of The Game of Thrones is coming to an end . It was time to present the contestants with an opportunity to double their money . The contestants have 24 hours left in the challenge and have a fun twist for tomorrow . The final episode will be shown on \"Game of Thrones\" at 8pm on Thursday .\\', \" Bailey and Suzie take their blindfolds off to see if they want to double their money . Suzie has earplugs in and noise cancellation headphones on top of them. She can\\'t hear us. Do you hear that? Bailey might. He might throw the music back in his ears. Suzie might. Maybe you get ahead of Bailey and steal the other person\\'s money .\", \\' \"It\\\\\\'s too much money\" asks viewers to vote for $360,000 or $1 million . Karl and Kris say Suzie and Suzie would never speak again if both press the steal button . Karl: \"I could do so much. Do you want to split the money or steal it?\" Kris: \"We both deserve half for sure\"\\', \" If the room turns red,\\\\xa0\\\\xa0then someone stole,\\\\xa0\\\\xa0 then you split the money . If you go on my store in the Shop app, you can tell me whatever you want for the holiday. And I\\'m going to be fulfilling thousands of wishes.
